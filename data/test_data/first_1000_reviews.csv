54,2.0,"High expectations, disappointing reality","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Brilliant, hard-working team members. Remote work allows for slightly more flexibility than a typical 9-5 job. The material the team puts out is world-class and top-notch. Most team members are incredibly helpful and kind. Monthly education and tech reimbursement that, while small, is helpful.","Oh man, I'm so sad to write this review. I've been a customer of the company myself since 2010, having spent $1,000+ of my own money on the products (and I've gifted the book to 5+ people). Joining the team I had high expectations and loved the company company, but after I left I was incredibly disappointed during my 2+ years with the organization. Here's why:

* Compensation is below industry standards, as seen for multiple positions and compared to data found on Glassdoor, Payscale, and Salary.com. Even after negotiating multiple times, the company rarely budges and I was paid 5-10% below market rate.

* In the 2 years I was there, there was only 1 title promotion given to an employee. You likely won't ever have the chance of a title change which is the very definition of a ""dead-end"" job.

* More and more team members are coming in who are unfamiliar with the company's products, especially at the executive level. The company is on the path to becoming a product factory where quality decreases just for the sake of more revenue. Meetings are now focused on ""how much money did we make, how can we optimize the sales funnel?"" instead of ""what good are we doing for the world?"" We saw this with a recent product where refund rates and dissatisfaction was abnormally high -- and I think this trend will continue.

* There's a clear divide developing between a high-ranking executive member and the rest of the organization. This dissatisfaction is real, and I think it will lead to a lot of really good leaders and team members leaving over the next few months.

* The are no volunteer or ""giving back"" opportunities supported by the organization. If you just want to work for a company that's focused on money, this may be the job for you. But if you want to work for a company where you have the chance to become more well-rounded and do good for the world, this probably isn't it.

* For a company that compares itself against San Francisco startups, their benefits package is extremely weak. Most startups now offer unlimited vacation, free movie passes, stock options, free meals, and more. I Will Teach You to be Rich does none of this (and their 401(k), while mostly strong, requires a LONG vesting period for company match).

* For most positions, it's a requirement to track time. This shows an overall lack of trust the company has in employees. I felt more micromanaged and tracked than I have in any other job I've been in.

Overall, I wish I Will Teach You to be Rich was a better company to work for. During the 2 years I was there, I felt mostly disappointment and saddened by the realities of working for the company. I'll continue to be a customer of their products but, when asked, I've told people they should not work there and will continue to do so.",,x,o,x,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/I-Will-Teach-You-To-Be-Rich-Reviews-E995948.htm,"Mar 2, 2016 ", Anonymous Employee,,I-Will-Teach-You-To-Be-Rich

58,5.0,Amazing Opportunity for the Right Person,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","The company went through a rough patch a few years back, and they've worked hard to rebuild and change the way they do things. The environment and business structure is very different than it was a few years ago, and the same goes for the attitude of the management. They are hyper-focused on being an industry leader and producing high quality, high value products. For the ambitious individual, there are lots of opportunities for promotions and career development. Also many opportunities to gain skills in a wide variety of areas. The projects are exciting, the pace is fast, and you can do it all from the comfort of your own home (if that's your thing). Compensation has always been more than fair. Also, they expect you to work HARD, which I personally found refreshing. The standards are high, and if you are half committed, or just want to clock it in, it will get noticed and be addressed. Personally I respect management for this and I like the challenge of working hard. The CEO is a visionary, and the content he and the team produces truly is excellent. It feels good to work for a company whose products you stand behind and believe in.","The hours are not quite flexible as advertised. While you don't have to work M-F, 9-5, you also can't veer too far from it because you have to attend meetings and communicate with team members usually during those hours. Also, working from home is not for everyone. You are more isolated and less connected than you would be in an office. A lot of people love this independence but again it's not for everyone. Since the brand is highly connected to the CEO as a person, the line is sometimes blurred between which decisions are his personal call and which are business decisions open for debate. This can be frustrating at times.",,v,r,v,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/I-Will-Teach-You-To-Be-Rich-Reviews-E995948.htm,"Feb 20, 2020 ", Anonymous Employee,,I-Will-Teach-You-To-Be-Rich

The pay is on par with other similar positions in the industry. There are Managers that are very effective at their roles and do a good job of listening to their employees (for the most part). The CEO knows everyones names and back stories and seems genuinely interested in the employees. Same goes for other VP's/ higher up managers.  It is hard to explain all of the pros unless you have worked here and do not get me wrong, this is a good place to work, if you can over come the pros listed below","The push to sell has become has become as, if not more, important then the quality of service being provided to our patrons. Many parts of the sales process are out of the hands of the employees (can the sales dept close the sale, can u/w issue the sales etc), and when employees both current and former have expressed concerns about this metric, they are met with a canned response from someone in leadership (please see prior reviews for examples).
Instead of looking for alternatives, that reinforce the behaviors of offering new products, Calcas is  focusing on the number of issued sales, this is not fair to the employees!

Another issue is the staffing, or lack thereof. Calcas is nearly always slammed with calls due to being understaffed  or due to employees attendance, and we are now being cross trained to help other departments that are struggling to keep up with the amount of work they have. I understand the need to keep expenses low, but where is the line between cost effective and being cheap? 

There is very little ""growth"" in the company. There are several employees on the phone that have been with the company since 1980. This is due to the company being so small.

All the perks for employees have been stripped away 

There is high scrutiny on home inspections making it very difficult for their members to obtain home insurance.

Starting salaries are competitive and performance bonuses are provided at many levels.

There are three service centers, one of which has consistently shown poor leadership and work environment and as a result, incurs large layoffs.  One department  to which out for is claims.  Leadership from the top down displays chaotic behavior and inconsistent values.  If you choose to work in claims, make sure you probe deeply to determine what kind of environment you enter.  The company is shrinking and continues to push cost cuts over profit and market growth.  Claims just went through a round of layoffs in the field area and it appears this trend will continue, so job uncertainty is evident.  You will also find situations where you can be terminated for one instance (non-egregious) without warning while other units allow similar situations to continue without consequence.  The company touts  due process when dealing with discipline issues, but in reality, many terminations are decided by a claims management committee and outcomes are often decided based on personal biases and not objective reasoning.  Job rotations are mandatory and are pushed on you whether you want them or not and without a written development plan.  In a two year period, you can find yourself with two, sometimes three different managers who are rotated.    These are just a few examples and many more exist.

Unlike other companies, the call volumes and the workload is manageable. Even with their change to an all day queue system, I actually can't wait to be able to make my calls and do my work when I need to! There's other opportunities to grow as a claims adjuster here since you handle auto, injury and property claims. The variety makes the day go by fast. I actually have a great manager who knows her stuff. The other employees have been here a long time, so they've done their time and they have awesome experiences and knowledge. Sure, I've heard them talk about me, too, but once I've mastered their systems and handled the claims in a consistent way, I'm sure that will stop. Don't let it get to you. It's just a job and there's plenty of work to focus on. Time off is hard to get when competing with high seniority, but that comes with any company that someone is new to. Some of the employees have their kids stay with them at their desk, so this is a company that understands when parents are in a bind with daycare, etc. ~ you don't find that at other companies! The customers can be difficult, but this is an industry where people are upset and not always happy with your decision. As for the older customers, I find them a delight to talk with and they are the first ones to make me feel good about what I do for them. Also, the pay is great! Maybe not the benefits, but then, in today's work environment, what company is delivering awesome benefits anymore? This is a great change for someone who has done claims at other companies. You can bring your experience and build on it, once you get past their systems. If you're new, I would think this is a great place to learn, too. Every new adjuster struggled and felt overwhelmed their first 2 years. If you can get past that and focus on the work, you'll actually find some enjoyment in it.","Systems are outdated and hard to maneuver through. My only concern is it affects my body. Lots of repeat steps to accomplish something and it's taking its toll on the hands and arms. It's a small company so they don't have the means to improve their systems right now, but it does sound like an excuse when they say that every time. As employees, we don't like excuses any more than leaders like to hear them from their workers. At least acknowledge it and get a plan in place to work on or solve the problem in the future (even if it is a 2-5 year plan). Otherwise, you (the leaders) run the risk of being considered ""part of the problem"". I do miss having a company that supports getting your AIC or CPCU or SCLA.

California Casualty has been around for over 100 years and it's not just a coincidence that they have such a solid reputation to the members they insure. They are family owned business and values work-life balance. 

From a personal perspective, I have the ability to work out in the morning or spend time with my family earlier in the day before going into work. This has greatly helped my family and I am very thankful that my schedule allows me to do this.

From a sales representative perspective, you have so many resources and tools to your disposal to be successful. They have comprehensive training so that once completed you can run with the bulls and immediately start selling. 

There are plenty of leads assigned to you and there are enough that there are no issues when it comes to ""not having enough"". 

Management is great, they give you plenty of room for you to succeed but will always be available to offer any training you need. You have one manager who is very technical and very detailed about specific requirements needed if you are stuck with a specific client. On the other hand, you have the newest manager who has been in the field for over 15 years and brings a totally different perspective when it comes to how the members view California Casualty and what is the best way to approach each individual lead to be successful. Both manager's compliment each other and ultimately are there for us to succeed. 

I was 1 of 4 lucky to be selected and our class immediately became very close. Iron sharpens iron and that has been our mentality. In our first year alone we are bringing some serious numbers to the KC office.

The other disappointing factor is the people you work with that have 20-35 years and are a ""clique"". Managers do not know how to ""manage"" today's workers - they are still stuck in the 80's! All they need is a good lawsuit to teach them that time has actually been better for the employee and they need to be careful how they treat them. There is a serious seniority gap between those that are new and those that don't have the skills or the ability to be able to leave this company, ie: the managers and their senior employees. And to this point, good luck getting any time off when you are competing with such high seniority. Now I see why there are not a whole lot of people here between the 4-20 year gap - they've all quit! And, I don't know of any other company that does their vacation bidding for the next 6 months; everywhere else I've worked, you bid for the next year, not the next 6 months. We can't even bid for holidays next year because this company doesn't open up their calendars.

The benefits are truly the worst I've ever had in my entire life! Had I known - truly known - how bad it was, I would have never accepted the job at this company! They don't even encourage you to take insurance courses and we had to pay to get our own licenses! The training was absolutely horrible - if you come from another company and did this job before, you will be fine and actually know more about the job than the trainer, who would rather be a fashion designer, I think. But if you're like me and never did insurance before, it is so difficult, especially when the managers disappear for ""hours"" for their ""lunch"" or ""pedicures"", so don't expect any help there.

I don't know how much longer this company can be in business. It seems most of their customers are pushing 100 years old and they pay an arm and a leg for insurance that doesn't cover them like other companies. You don't see a push for new customers and since the company doesn't put any money into their employees, systems, or training, it just seems like this ""family owned business"" is going to go the way of the world and die a slow death. As for me, I don't plan on being here much longer and if you are wanting to work in a REAL claims environment where things work, go anywhere else but here!",,x,r,x,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/California-Casualty-Reviews-E3114.htm,"Nov 5, 2014 ", Claims Adjuster,,California-Casualty

I was tired of driving to work everyday and feeling sick to my stomach. There is really only one con in this company = management. 50% of the management in the outbound sales department are condescending, sarcastic, overbearing, and make you dread coming into work everyday.  Just last week, everyone was told by managment that non-work related conversations were no longer allowed and you can longer be out of your desk area unless your discussing a work issue. I mean, come on!...sometimes you just want to ask how someone is doing and chat for a minute but apparently ""we are paid to get sales and that's it"". The office is now even more gloomy and negative due to this new mandate. Management is only in the office 50 percent of the time due to constant interviewing and meetings but when they are in the office, they micromanage to the extreme! Even the experienced reps get coached and listened to when they actually have more experience than the manager that's listening to them. You'll also get write-ups for the smallest mistakes and yes! ..they actually call them ""write ups"" , just like you got in high school. Everyone is in constant fear of losing their jobs and my coworkers talked about quitting everyday because they are so frustrated with the way things are and the way they get treated. There was a great group of mature people in the sales department and I hope they don't run everyone out out there but it doesn't look good for the remaining employees.

Also, they subtle pass a message that they can tolerate you once you keep slaving for the company, once you apply for internal openings with higher pay or responsibility....here comes your TPL with flimsy notice letter which then puts you through a coaching process for 3 weeks and part of that process is you no longer eligible to apply for any internal openings for the next 6 months.. and the cycle continues and there goes growth and development. They have this wellness department that says you go to them if you need some work place accommodation. They will take you round a circus by first making it look like they are going to do something about your situation. Emails upon emails, and you are referred to HR personnel who appear to genuinely understand your situation and then they referrals keeps going up until it gets to the top where you have a final meeting with the person who's job is to pass the sad news...yes, get ready because you see it all over the face when you go for that meeting. They'll first refer you to some work policies....they always have a window in their terms and conditions to not do anything for you....trust insurance companies. You genuinely try helping a customer who you can clearly see wasn't paid a claim due to some mistakes on the part of the customer that could be corrected and you try Advising the client on what needs to be done....yeah, the quality department flags it off and your TPL calls you for a meeting that you are supposed not to reveal much information. The idea of course is how to fleece customers of hardworking money they paid into the insurance. The coach you on how to provide just ""the right information"" and with hold the rest. They warn you never to say more than the customer asks for..technically a client needs to have sufficient information on what they want or insurance won't divulge. For those who have life insurance please let your loved ones know or your attorney ...make a will. They will never voluntarily contact a family. If payment stops coming, and they are aware the person is death.. the file goes into limpo...I have seen them make grieving families go through hell to get a pay out.

Senior leaders do not know how to connect with and lead other leaders which has a trickle down effect to staff. For example the idea of creating a safe and inclusive environment; it sounds great and attractive as it's a current societal goal but they have no idea how to bring that culture to life.

 During my ~4 years as a leader I saw the steady erosion of morale and motivation as a direct result. My ability to support and empower staff was greatly limited due to this.

They say they are pay for performance, but they are not. Bonuses are determined based on a bell-curve and overall performance has little to do with bonus payout.

Additionally, salaries are incredibly low compared to similar companies in similar geographies.

The work environment is not psychologically safe. If you do not share a popular opinion it is not valued or fully heard. Senior leaders greatly lack any form of emotional intelligence.

Advancement is massively challenging. They do not promote; despite doing the work of a senior role you must apply and then you must navigate the political waters and agendas of others; your performance has little to do with where you can go within the organization.",,x,v,x,2,2,1,4,2.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Canada-Life-Reviews-E23636.htm,"Mar 21, 2022 ", Manager Business Systems Analyst,,Canada-Life

716,1.0,DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME - STRAIGHT UP CUBICLE JOB,Former Employee,"Nothing at all, it’s a paycheque but it’s not much. Company seems to rebrand every few years due to its poor reputation. Labor Standards Board well aware of this company.","- High turn-over rate
- Got hired with 2 other people and by end of 1st month both those people quit, started looking for new job after 1 month
- Unfriendly, negative staff and management
- Everything is based on popularity and productivity
- Training program consistent on mood of trainer with no structure and information often lacking or incorrect, trainer assigns tasks above skill level and will blame you for not knowing how to do it or asking for tasks that cover topics current discussed in ‘training’
- often micro-aggressions and sexist remarks from supervisors and managers, mgmt and overall office is predominantly Caucasian and huge age gaps between old timers who didnt get laid off from merger and young people who only last less than a year
- mgmt mostly focused on complaining rather than finding solutions 
- You pay for the extended health benefits and it’s only good if you’re willing to lose half of your pay
- Technology is way outdated and ‘newest’ platform is from 2000...company uses constant spreadsheets to keep track of claims by using 5 different programs (1of which is a pirated version)
- Office culture is as outdated as the technology
- Pay is already but low in comparison within the industry, HR sold me on the benefits and the ‘bonus’
- Bonuses are out of reach as no one does good on performance reviews that are only based on numbers vs professional performance
- Expectations from mgmt are unrealistic and don’t give coaching, expectation is you have to answer all phone calls, return all IMs and emails within the hour, and emails often forwarded to mgmt if someone perceives it to be negative
- Cubicle job with no team or mgmt support, everyone is looking out for themselves and trying to kiss up to get promotions (only way to get promoted)
- Supervisors and mgrs micro-manage and treat you like a child
- Many issues consistently made due to high volumes of claims processed per hour (20 claims/hr), in 1 quarter this office/team had made $130,000 in claim payment errors, mgr quickly blamed staff for errors
- Mgmt focused more on blaming people rather than finding solutions to errors or coach/train staff properly
- Useless meetings that could have been an email or have no clear direction and take up at least half hour of your day
- Supervisors and mgr quick to reassign tasks and claims to others if you make one honest mistake
- No opportunities to learn from mistakes, but shamed for by supervisors and mgmt for making mistakes
- Supervisor responsible for assigning tasks and files and does so according to mood they’re in, some people get a few and some get a lot
- Lying about company and position common, I was told through recruitment process job was available because of recent merger, found out as soon as I started merger occurred 2 years prior and it was obvious job was vacant because someone walked off job
- This is NOT a FULL TIME JOB, but a job that pays you the salary based on 7.5/day but you’re always working at least 10hrs/day unpaid and uncomp’d due to supervisors and mgrs emailing you within final 30mins of 7.5hr day with more work for you to do, you will get in trouble if you don’t/cant’ work past 37.5 hrs per week
- Constant long IMs and emails from supervisors and mgrs pointing out everything you’ve done wrong and reaming you out for it
- “Training” is only presented in 1 way and not adaptable to others ways of learning, don’t bother asking to adapt as this will create issues btw you and supervisor/mgmt
- Supervisor often doesn’t answer IMs regarding questions, but will send erractic messages loosely based on your question and often sent at all hours of the night, frequent msgs from supervisor were sent at 4am!
- Unprofessional and out of touch with reality and current employment standards
- Mgrs do not actively train or take mgmt or leadership courses
- Zero leadership with disillusional mgrs
- Slight bullying environment, one sr case manager will email you and mgrs if you don’t set something up the way they prefer it even though info is there and correct and will throw you under the bus to claimants even if you weren’t to blame",,x,x,x,1,1,1,1,1.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Canada-Life-Reviews-E23636.htm,"Jun 3, 2021 ", Disability Claims Processor,,Canada-Life

735,2.0,Just as bad for employees and is it for customers,Former Employee,Benefits packages are good as long as you're a full-time employee and can access them,"It's the people that I left not the organization. 

I expected to work in a respectful and professional environment, but instead found the culture to be the complete opposite. This organization is filled with unprofessionalism, duplicity, and a lack of accountability that saturated every interaction from colleagues to executive leadership. 

I (and I'm sure many others) went through several cycles of burnout in a relatively short time. That led to a sense of disillusionment that became so strong that it negatively affected my performance and engagement. There was also very little stability in terms of workload. A last minute ""urgent"" request was expected to be honored. Leadership also pressed for administrative tasks to be completed before a deadline so it would reflect well on them. They did that with the full knowledge that everyone was already struggling to complete a long list of assignments. 

Salaries are low for the industry (some roles as much as 25k less than the average). There's also no real reward system in the sense that bonuses don't reflect your hard work and salary raises are more akin to being on par with cost of living. It's not worth it to go ""above and beyond"". This kills your motivation if you're trying to further your career or advance your professional skill set. 

Speaking of professional development, even if you qulalify for education expenses don't expect support. They aren't interested because it's more beneficial to them if you stay right where you are.",,x,o,r,2,2,1,1,1.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Canada-Life-Reviews-E23636.htm,"Feb 28, 2021 ", Analyst,,Canada-Life

There is a serious movement to bring the organization into the 21st century. One of the few companies that has built entire teams specifically for customer experience and innovation.

Compensation is above average.

Since CanadaLife is one of the few major players in the assurance space, there is a lot of really meaningful work available that can have a nationwide impact.","First off,  the company is HUGE (# of employees and office space) so I can only speak to generalities at a high level.

The company is in year 3 of a mega culture transformation. The changes at a leadership level have been non-stop, which affects everything from process to direction to system of values.

If we were to create a spectrum defining ""ways of working,"" tech companies and startups would be at one end of the spectrum for 'modern' whereas Canada Life would be at the other end of the spectrum for 'not modern.'

1) Email is the primary tool for too many functions; communication, work management, file sharing and calendar management. Inboxes get out of hand very quickly, information gets buried very quickly, silos are created inadvertently and unnecessary meetings are booked.

2) Lack of diversity at senior levels.

3) Extremely risk averse. Innovation and new ways of working face a constant uphill battle. Many layers of red tape and naysayers.

956,3.0,"Collegial with a lots of future potential, but behind the times....","Current Employee, less than 1 year","The draw to join this organization was that they are embarking upon a transformation of their Canadian business.  I knew this would mean interesting and challenging work and change and that has been the case.  

I would say of the many employers I have had in past, there is a genuine interest and concern for employee well-being and work/life balance.  It is a collegial work environment and I am enjoying the people I am working with.  People generally like working here and take a lot of pride in the company.

I feel well compensated for what I do - they are higher on base and lower on variable pay i.e. bonus but that works fine for me.  They have nice staff perks like discounted tickets for Jays, the Aquarium, etc. which is nice.  There is an onsite gym with great classes that costs next to nothing for employees.

The organization has been largely successful to date so is built on a solid foundation.  It is an exciting time to be apart of it.","The company has been successful to date but are severely behind the times.  They have not invested in basic infrastructure in a significant amount of time which means systems are dated, legacy in nature and home grown, don't 'talk to each other' and very little is integrated and automated.  As a result, there are a ton of inefficiencies and broken processes, largely manual in nature and paper based.  I get the sense this is because there is a big focus on expenses/cost, but they would have been better off to invest incrementally over the years vs. being in the position now where they have to overhaul everything which is hugely expensive.

The average tenure of employees is extremely high relative to anywhere else I have every worked and there is very low turnover.  In some ways that is positive - people like working here, etc. - but on the flip side it contributes to the lack of innovation, efficiency or basically just keeping up with the times.  People don't know what they don't know, so trying to affect change is difficult and can be very frustrating for those driving the change, and for external hires in general who are used to more sophisticated work environments.  There seems to be a lack of awareness of what is going on in the external market and it is an inward looking culture.  

Senior leaders make all the decisions and don't empower those below them to do so.  The plan is to change that which is good.  There is a strong sentiment of 'management' vs. 'staff', which is hierarchical and  antiquated.  In addition there is a lack of communication on a regular basis to the employee population about basic things like the annual strategic objectives/goals, messages around the need to change, etc. as well as messaging to the outside about what it's like to be apart of the company and the things are doing.  It is not clear with the masses what the case for change/transformation is, people don't understand the vision, etc.  Information seems to be guarded/held at the top and is not shared, even though at times I don't understand why they are not sharing certain things.  As a result, it feels patriarchal.  The Communication strategy and practices needed to be overhauled.

My closing comment is that there is a lot of potential for this organization, which is why I joined.  It has been very successful to date but there is recognition of the need to change and adapt which is compelling.  It will be a journey but there will be a huge amount of capacity released if we reduce manual/administrative work, which will in turn create more interesting and meaningful jobs.",,x,o,r,3,4,3,5,4.0,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Canada-Life-Reviews-E23636.htm,"May 12, 2016 ", Anonymous Employee,,Canada-Life

969,4.0,"Awesome education support, dismal salaries","Current Employee, more than 5 years","GWL provides educational support and I find it quite generous in that regard.  They compensate you before you take the course or exam so you're not left with cash out for several months.  If you don't pass they don't require reimbursement with the pretense that you pay out of your own pocket your next go around.

I have also been quite challenged in my roles.  There is a lot of empowerment and not that much micro managing in my area, although that does creep up sometimes. I have a very competent boss from whom I'm learning loads!

There are a lot of opportunities for growth. And the share ownership plan is excellent. GWL as a corporation has also just introduced personal days. We get 2 now! WOW! They are really using the employee survey to improve our benefits and worklife balance and I appreciate that.

The people are also great and very knowledgeable.  They love their jobs and I love mine, just need to have some money commensurate with all the hard work I do.

Great gym classes. Super challenging and breaks up the day nicely. There is a range, variety, and you sweat for sure.","Progressing from one job grade to the next within your current role is tough if you aren't the function that's making the money for GWL!  

There is no feedback on performance until it has to be done for a PA. And even if you get an ""exceptional"" or ""outstanding"" which is the max you are not guaranteed a raise.

The company takes care of those that make them money and that makes complete sense to me.  It's a highly intelligent company. The thing is, they will lose those people that could have made them loads of cash had they been rewarded with positive recognition in the form of a >market adj raise, which is really peanuts in their books.

There is no training - learn on your own.  Not a huge offense to me as I think it could be a great learning experience, but could discourage some.

1. its extremly, extremly controlling. You need to write down every single task you did a day and write down how much time that took you. Then the manager will check it. They say, you need to do that for ""statistiks"" but everyone know thats a lie. 
2. No talking allowed. I know, its absolute crazy. No talking during work or you get a angry view or even a 'pssscht' from your teamlead. Same with phones, btw. I had a lot of talks about using my phone to much, even I didnt. I just checken maybe every two hours if I received an E-Mail.
3. extremly political and old school. In the claims team, you won't get positive feedback, ever. As I told my manager how I feel about only received really negative feedback all the time, she said: ""I am sorry that you cant handle feedback"". 
4.  make yourself ready of the most extreme micromanagment, you will ever see. The first few months you will really feel like the manager stalks you. 5 E-Mail minimum per day about really small mistakes. Every department knows about the issues with the claims manager and made fun of it. 
5. Managers nearly get a panick attack if you just say the words ""flexi-day, vacation or paid overtime"". After a year I still had no idea how that stuff works. 
6. for some reason the german team gets favored. Like, if you ask for holidays in a certain week AND someone from Germany asks too (but even after you) the german one will get it. I have no idea why it is like that. 
7. Benefits are really poor. No health insurance, no life insurance, only 20 days holidays. 
8.

The admin support staff aren't even eligible to apply! Of course, your manager can waive that ONLY IF he thinks you are too good, so that means you need to suck up. They have a poor computer system which causes massive human errors and believe it or not.. those are ""your"" mistakes which became obstacles for you to further advance in the company.

Work volume is quite high. Tonnes of claimants call every day and you can't get much done. Overtime is not allowed unless approved by your manager, so if you can't finish your work, they aren't nice and you have to stay overtime without pay and it becomes your problem.

977,2.0,"Unstructured, disjoint, and unconcerned thereof",Former Employee,"There were a multitude of good co-workers, good people who placed the work that they were doing ahead of themselves, and did whatever it took for their department despite a lack of recognition or encouragement, and sometimes even discouragement from management. There were many staff members who took client interests to heart, and provided service that was courteous, effective, and genuine. There were managers who provided encouragement and empowerment, and were a genuine pleasure to work under.","Having listed many positives above, the negatives unfortunately outweigh these factors. I think the best way to understand this company and the other reviews posted is to be aware that its operation as a whole is very disjoint and piecemeal. Acquired subsidiaries and individual departments all operate more or less independent of one another. That is not to say that the parent company as a whole does not install company wide initiatives, values, and directives, but on the whole interpretation of and compliance with these measures are not practiced nor enforced effectively. With that in mind, the above rating, and all others are more affected by the individual department in which a given employee works, rather than the company as a whole. 

The employee experience within any given department is most affected by the quality of the leadership within that area, and the overall company provides little or no impact to an individual's day-to-day experience. Many leaders within the company possess and air of superiority, and a privileged mindset in that they feel entitled to perks not afforded to staff, such as additional breaks, increased time for socialization, and working from home at their leisure. They generally regard staff as a means to an end, and not as individuals with concerns and aspirations, and take pleasure in pointing out flaws. They feel no responsibility to their staff, and as such, staff members feel unappreciated and unsupported.

Furthering this feeling is a lack of competency in many managers in ensuring the department as a whole meets targets and obligations. Many manager's abilities do not extend beyond the repetition of buzzwords, and lack an adequate understanding of how their department functions, what it needs to accomplish, and what it is accomplishing currently. Many state that they do not know what is going on in their department, and rely on feedback from staff to know if targets are not being met. In some areas, this has led to non-compliance with court orders, and lengthy delays in freezing assets in cases of bankruptcy. Managers are not being held accountable for these and other shortcomings, and the negative results are often transferred to front-line staff.",,x,x,x,3,2,1,2,1.0,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Canada-Life-Reviews-E23636.htm,"Nov 18, 2015 ", Anonymous Employee,,Canada-Life
