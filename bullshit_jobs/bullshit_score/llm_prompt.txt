The Cambridge Dictionary describes something bureaucratic as something "involving complicated rules and processes that make something slow and difficult".

I am now showing you a job review. The review describes the negative aspects of the job:

{{REVIEW}}

On a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, rate how much 'bureaucratic bullshit work' you would associate with this job, based on the given review. A bs_score of 0.0 means that the review is not indicative of any 'bureaucratic bullshit work', while a bs_score of 1.0 means that this review describes heavily bureaucratic bullshit work. Any score between 0.0 and 1.0 is possible.

Return your final score in a JSON object; i.e.

{"bs_score": 0.4} # Example Score
