The Cambridge Dictionary describes something bureaucratic as something "involving complicated rules and processes that make something slow and difficult".

I am now showing you a job review. The review describes the negative aspects of the job:

<review>
{{REVIEW}}
</review>

On a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, rate how much 'bureaucratic bullshit work' is described in the given review. 
A bs_score of 0.0 means that the review is not indicative of any 'bureaucratic bullshit work', while a bs_score of 1.0 means that this review describes heavily bureaucratic bullshit work.
Reason your answer and look for tangible evidence, but keep yourself very brief.

Return your final score in a JSON object; i.e.

{"bs_score": 0.4} # Example Score

In all circumstances, explain your reasoning and show your final assessment in the JSON object. If you feel that no bureaucratic bullshit work is described, return {"bs_score": 0.0}
